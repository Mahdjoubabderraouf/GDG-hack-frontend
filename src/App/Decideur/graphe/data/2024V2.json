In particular, during finalization of a `CREATE` or `CREATE2`, in the case that the substack execution happens successfully, `rust-evm` will first commit the substate, and then call `record_external_operation(Write(out_code.len()))`. If `record_external_operation` later fails, this error is returned to the parent call stack, instead of `Succeeded`. Yet, the substate commitment already happened. This causes smart contracts able to commit state changes, when the parent caller contract receives zero address (which usually indicates that the execution has failed). This issue only impacts library users with custom `record_external_operation` that returns errors. The issue is patched in release 0.41.1. No known workarounds are available."

In certain configurations an attacker could leak the devtools authentication token and then abuse other RPC functions to achieve RCE. The `getTextAssetContent` function does not check for path traversals, this could allow an attacker to read arbitrary files over the RPC WebSocket. The WebSocket server does not check the origin of the request leading to cross-site-websocket-hijacking. This may be intentional to allow certain configurations to work correctly. Nuxt Devtools authentication tokens are placed within the home directory of the current user. The malicious webpage can connect to the Devtools WebSocket, perform a directory traversal brute force to find the authentication token, then use the *authenticated* `writeStaticAssets` function to create a new Component, Nitro Handler or `app.vue` file which will run automatically as the file is changed. This vulnerability has been addressed in release version 1.3.9. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

Superusers who have their credentials (username + password) compromised could potentially have the second-factor authentication bypassed if an attacker somehow managed to authenticate to Open Forms. The maintainers of Open Forms do not believe it is or has been possible to perform this login. However, if this were possible, the victim's account may be abused to view (potentially sensitive) submission data or have been used to impersonate other staff accounts to view and/or modify data. Three mitigating factors to help prevent exploitation include: the usual login page (at `/admin/login/`) does not fully log in the user until the second factor was succesfully provided; the additional non-MFA protected login page at `/api/v2/api-authlogin/` was misconfigured and could not be used to log in; and there are no additional ways to log in. This also requires credentials of a superuser to be compromised to be exploitable. Versions 2.2.9, 2.3.7, 2.4.5, and 2.5.2 contain the following patches to address these weaknesses: Move and only enable the API auth endpoints (`/api/v2/api-auth/login/`) with `settings.DEBUG = True`. `settings.DEBUG = True` is insecure and should never be applied in production settings. Additionally, apply a custom permission check to the hijack flow to only allow second-factor-verified superusers to perform user hijacking."

            "value": "Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.\n\nMany systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.\n\nBecause `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.\n\nDocker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.\n\nMoby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace."

However, this process does not enforce strict SSL/TLS verification, nor does it validate the digital signature of the received update files. An attacker with the capability to perform DNS spoofing can exploit this weakness.

The system saves exception details into a session array without proper sanitization or encoding. These details are later rendered into HTML and executed in a JavaScript block within the user's browser, without adequate escaping of HTML entities. This flaw allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers can inject malicious scripts into the admin panel by triggering exceptions with controlled input. The exploitation method involves using any function that might throw an exception with user-controllable argument. This issue can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized administrative actions, posing a significant security risk. Version 2024-04 contains a fix for the issue."

While there are efforts to prevent DDoS by implementing a timeout on requests, it is possible for an attacker to issue a large number of requests to the server which will be handled in batches based on the configuration of the Mealie server. The chunking of responses is helpful for mitigating memory exhaustion on the Mealie server, however a single request to an arbitrarily large external file (e.g. a Debian ISO) is often sufficient to completely saturate a CPU core assigned to the Mealie container. Without rate limiting in place, it is possible to not only sustain traffic against an external target indefinitely, but also to exhaust the CPU resources assigned to the Mealie container. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.0."

In detail, the length of the `_uri` string is checked instead of the length of the `_proxy` string. The `_gcoap_forward_proxy_copy_options()` function does not implement an explicit size check before copying data to the `cep->req_etag` buffer that is `COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX` bytes long. If an attacker can craft input so that `optlen` becomes larger than `COAP_ETAG_LENGTH_MAX`, they can cause a buffer overflow. If the input above is attacker-controlled and crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.

A stored HTML Injection vulnerability has been identified in the Email Receival Module of the Freescout Application. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious HTML content into emails sent to the application's mailbox. This vulnerability arises from improper handling of HTML content within incoming emails, allowing attackers to embed malicious HTML code in the context of the application's domain. Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious HTML content into emails. This could lead to various attacks such as form hijacking, application defacement, or data exfiltration via CSS injection. Although unauthenticated attackers are limited to HTML injection, the consequences can still be severe. Version 1.8.139 implements strict input validation and sanitization mechanisms to ensure that any HTML content received via emails is properly sanitized to prevent malicious HTML injections."

            "value": " urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations."

Directus allows redirects when importing file from the URL and does not check the result URL. Thus, it is possible to execute a request to an internal IP, for example to 127.0.0.1. However, it is blind SSRF, because Directus also uses response interception technique to get the information about the connect from the socket directly and it does not show a response if the IP address is internal.

However, using multiple commitments has been discouraged due to the additional cost to the verifier and it has not been supported in the recursive in-circuit Groth16 verifier and Solidity verifier. gnark's maintainers expect the impact of the issue be very small - only for the users who have implemented the native Groth16 verifier or are using it with multiple commitments. We do not have information of such users. The issue has been patched in version 0.11.0.

Prior to version 0.11.0, commitments to private witnesses in Groth16 as implemented break the zero-knowledge property. The vulnerability affects only Groth16 proofs with commitments. Notably, PLONK proofs are not affected. The vulnerability affects the zero-knowledge property of the proofs - in case the witness (secret or internal) values are small, then the attacker may be able to enumerate all possible choices to deduce the actual value. If the possible choices for the variables to be committed is large or there are many values committed, then it would be computationally infeasible to enumerate all valid choices. It doesn't affect the completeness/soundness of the proofs. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 0.11.0. The patch to fix the issue is to add additional randomized value to the list of committed value at proving time to mask the rest of the values which were committed. As a workaround, the user can manually commit to a randomized value."

Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability by injecting JavaScript into the `label` parameter, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser. The `/wireui/button` endpoint dynamically renders button labels based on user-provided input via the `label` query parameter. Due to insufficient sanitization or escaping of this input, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript. By crafting such a request, an attacker can inject arbitrary code that will be executed by the browser when the endpoint is accessed. If exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the affected website. This could lead to: **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies, tokens, or other sensitive information. **User Impersonation**: Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users. **Phishing**: Redirecting users to malicious websites. **Content Manipulation**: Altering the appearance or behavior of the affected page to mislead users or execute further attacks. The severity of this vulnerability depends on the context of where the affected component is used, but in all cases, it poses a significant risk to user security. This issue has been addressed in release versions 1.19.3 and 2.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."

Starting in version 1.11 and prior to versions 2.18.8 and 2.24.8, `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` did not verify TLS certificates on HTTPS connections. This could lead to connection details such as full URLs or credentials leaking in case of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` is also known as the builtin derivation builder `builtin:fetchurl`. It's not to be confused with the evaluation-time function `builtins.fetchurl`, which was not affected by this issue. A user may be affected by the risk of leaking credentials if they have a `netrc` file for authentication, or rely on derivations with `impureEnvVars` set to use credentials from the environment. In addition, the commonplace trust-on-first-use (TOFU) technique of updating dependencies by specifying an invalid hash and obtaining it from a remote  store was also vulnerable to a MITM injecting arbitrary store objects. This also applied to the impure derivations experimental feature. Note that this may also happen when using Nixpkgs fetchers to obtain new hashes when not using the fake hash method, although that mechanism is not implemented in Nix itself but rather in Nixpkgs using a fixed-output derivation. The behavior was introduced in version 1.11 to make it consistent with the Nixpkgs `pkgs.fetchurl` and to make `<nix/fetchurl.nix>` work in the derivation builder sandbox, which back then did not have access to the CA bundles by default. Nowadays, CA bundles are bind-mounted on Linux. This issue has been fixed in Nix 2.18.8 and 2.24.8. As a workaround, implement (authenticated) fetching with `pkgs.fetchurl` from Nixpkgs, using `impureEnvVars` and `curlOpts` as needed."

X-Forwarded-For request header is mainly used by proxy servers to identify the client and can be easily spoofed by an attacker pretending that the request comes from a different IP address.

Once RMAC_I message can be sent during a session, attacker with MITM access to the communication may intercept the original RMAC_I reply and save it. While the session continues, the attacker will record all of the replies and save them, till capturing the message to be replied (can be detected by ID, length or time based on inspection of visual activity next to the reader) Once attacker captures a session with the message to be replayed, he stops resetting the connection and waits for signal to perform the replay to of the PD to CP message (ex: by signaling remotely to the MIMT device or setting a specific timing). In order to replay, the attacker will craft a specific RMAC_I message in the proper seq of the execution, which will result in reverting the RMAC to the beginning of the session.

The problem rarely happened, but\nit was always while the pod was dying.\n\nThe root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.\n\nCIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that\nthe socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is\nalways freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.\n\nThe repro steps are roughly:\n\n  1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns\n  2. drop packets from the netns\n  3. destroy the netns\n  4. unmount CIFS\n\nWe can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see\nthe splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.\n\nWhen the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime\nwithout holding refcnt due to async timers.\n\nLet's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit\n9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").\n\nNote that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to\nclean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a\nfreed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().\n\nAlso, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because\nthe code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same\naddress happened to be reallocated to another netns.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS: VFS: \\\\XXXXXXXXXXX has not responded in 15 seconds.

This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long.
